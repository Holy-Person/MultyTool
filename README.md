## About
An Electron application based on "Modules", independent sub-folders for different uses.
Modules can be easily created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, featuring additional tools and an easy-to-use account system to save settings and data.

While some modules are already pre-installed with the latest release, other modules or module-updates can be downloaded on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/invites/9dcaKKSyKa).<br>
More info about our Discord Server can be found in the [Community](#community) section of this readme.

This is still under development and far from finished, v0.6.0 is supposed to be the first beta release featuring all of the planned creator features like accounts, settings, full documentations for additional tools and more.<br>
The current public release is v0.5.0-alpha, featuring basic module tools, a barren documentation and a fully usable piano module.

## Installation How-To
1. Download the MultyTool zip from the latest update.
2. Unzip the zip file.
