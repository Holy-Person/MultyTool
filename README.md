## So, what's this?
This is an Electron app, I am working on this on my own right now as a student, so development might be a bit slower than what you're used to.<br>
A module based Electron application, customizable depending on what module you need, the goal will be to make modules for whatever I might need with ease, or even create a module to create more modules, for now this will be a simple test for myself.

Any problems or suggestions? Send me an E-Mail [here](#help) or ask in the Discord.

## The stuff I use
Currently I'm using:
* Electron version: ?
* Chromium version: ?
* Node version: v12.18.1<br>
(Will be filled out once the menu update comes out)

## Install
I was thinking of keeping this project private for a little longer until I at least get the menu update out there, but the sooner people test the actual features the better.
