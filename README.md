## So, what's this?
This is an Electron app, I am working on this on my own right now as a student, so development might be a bit slower than what you're used to.<br>
A module based Electron application, customizable depending on what module you need, the goal will be to make modules for whatever I might need with ease, or even create a module to create more modules, for now this will be a simple test for myself.

Any problems or suggestions? Contact me [here](#help).
